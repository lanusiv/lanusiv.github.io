Today I set up my own blog here!
This is a post about the process of my set up, symobelly, a tutorial of creating blogs via github and Jekll. Now let's begin!

My setup is based on the offical site <url value="https://pages.github.com">GitHub Pages</url>, let's make it step by step.

1 Create a repository on GitHub
  The name must be username.github.io,where username is your username(or organization name) on GitHub.
  You should note that the username is the name you use in your GitHub,otherwise it won't work.
1 Clone the repository to your local computer
  Set up a new folder as to save the repository and open shell to clone:
    <itaric>git clone https://github.com/username/username/github.io</itaric>
