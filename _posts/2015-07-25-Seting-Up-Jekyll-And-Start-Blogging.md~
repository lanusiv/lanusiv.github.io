Today I set up my own blog here!
This is a post about the process of my set up, symobelly, a tutorial of creating blogs via github and Jekyll. Now let's begin!

My setup is based on the offical site <url value="https://pages.github.com">GitHub Pages</url>, let's make it step by step.

1 Create a repository on GitHub
  The name must be username.github.io,where username is your username(or organization name) on GitHub.
  You should note that the username is the name you use in your GitHub,otherwise it won't work.
2 Clone the repository to your local computer
  Set up a new folder as to save the repository and open shell to clone:
    <itaric>git clone https://github.com/username/username/github.io</itaric>
3 Commit,push file as common Repositories
  Like other repositories, this repository is just common as with others.Now let's commit a new file:
  cd username.github.io
  echo "Hello World" > index.html
  git add --all (or git add . , or git add [file list])
  git commit -m "Initial commit"
  git push -u origin master
 Tips: You may have to enter your username and password on every commit, which is too trouble.To solve this, one way is to config git to remember your password temporoly:
  git config --global credential.helper cache
  # set git to use the credential memory cache
 the default duration for cache is 15minutes, you can change the timeout by execute this;
  git config --global credential.helper 'cache --timeout=3600'
  # set the cache to timeout after 1 hour (setting is in seconds)

4 Go to the web you just created
  Open your web brower and type the url "http://username/github.io" and strike enter, you will see your page.

Generally, its over for you to post your own blog on GitHub, and everyone can read it. But what's more, there is a problem that you have to edit the web page all by yourself, not just the content of the post! So next, let's go on to set up a tool for editing the post for us. Here is "Jekyll".

5 Install Ruby
  To install Jekyll, Ruby is required,so first install Ruby(my system is ubuntu, you can refer to Installations of Ruby via https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation):
   1) sudo apt-get install ruby-full
   2) install Jekyll
      as in our country, the bitch GFW blocks the ruby souces, we need to do more things in order to install successfully.
      extras: change ruby gem source:
              sudo gem sources --remove https://rubygems.org/ (or https)
              sudo gem sources -a https://ruby.taobao.org/  (or https)
              
      sudo gem intall jekyll (-V)
---------------------
Wait, there was a probolem when I install Ruby on Ubuntu using apt-get: the latest version on the source is 1.9.1, but the instruction requires the version at least 2.0.0.
As I ignored this matter and went on, I met a trouble, I couldn't run 'Jekyll build --watch' successfully and go to next step. Finally, I have to reread the instruction and google search the isuee, I found the right way. Here is What to do:
  1) remove the previously installed ruby by run 'sudo apt-get autoremove ruby',
  2) install RVM, 
      $ curl -L https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable
      Note: if you are prompted this error:"curl: (7) Failed to connect to get.rvm.io port 443: 网络不可达",try this: echo ipv4 >> ~/.curlrc
  3) load rvm,
      $ source ~/.rvm/scripts/rvm
  4) check if install succeeded,
      $ rvm -v
      # rvm 1.26.11 (latest) by Wayne E. Seguin <wayneeseguin@gmail.com>, Michal Papis <mpapis@gmail.com> [https://rvm.io/]
  5) install Ruby by using RVM, you may wait for serval to tens of minutes,
      $ rvm install 2.2.2
      # 2.2.2 is the latest version since then
  6) set the default Ruby version,
      $ rvm 2.2.2 --default
  7) check Ruby version,
      $ ruby -v
      $ gem -v
  8) after that, you may need to isntall rails, though it may not necessary, as a new comer to Ruby's world, I choose to install anyway,
     $ gem install rails
     after,check if succeed
     $ rails -v
  9) now we are done installing ruby, let's go back and continue our blog set ups.

6 Install Bundler
  Bundler is a package manager that makes versioning Ruby software luke Jekyll a lot easier if you're going to building GitHub Pages sites locally. If you don't alreay have Bundler installed, you can isntall it by running the command 'gem install bundler'.
  After installing bundler, you run bundle init to initiate a file named GemFile in your repository root directory,
   $ bundle init
  open Gemfile and add the line [gem 'github-pages'], and run 'bundle install'.

7 Running Jekyll
  To run Jekyll in a way that matches the GitHub Pages build server, run Jekyll with Bundler. Use the command [bundle exec jekyll serve] in the root of your repository(after swiching to the gh-pages branch for project reppositories), and your site should be avaiable at [http;//localhost:4000].For a full list if Jekyll commands, ser the Jekyll documentation.
